# AP15 - Resource Pool

[Link to the exercise page](https://doppera-at.github.io/ap15/)

This repo acts as a resource pool for my classmates with focus on understanding.
It is kept simple on purpose and the code hasn't been always tested. Most code is written as needed 
for the tutorials, even when I have example code open in the right split.

So please feel free to point out any errors and mistakes!

I am fully aware that for many concepts there are already existing solutions that should be preferred 
in a production setting - writing these by yourself can deepen your understanding what is going on 
under the hood and having them written makes using these so much more enjoyable ^^
